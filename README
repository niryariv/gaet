This is a template for small GAE applications.

It doesn't do much, it's basically meant as one step further than the default stub created by the GAE Launcher.

The things it handles so far are:

* Basic directory structure
* Rails-like _method routing for easier PUT/DELTE
* Convenience render() method for templates
